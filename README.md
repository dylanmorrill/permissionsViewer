# Permission Viewer

NOTE: this is very much in development (as of 09/30/21). This a a long project I am working on that I'd estimate is 5% done.

I am working on trying to create a lightning app that shows an aggregated view of the following permissions for any user selected.
- Object permissions (create, read, write, delete, view all, mod all)
- Field permissions (read, write)
- System Permissions
- Record Access
-- How many records of x object can the user view, view and edit, or view edit and delete
